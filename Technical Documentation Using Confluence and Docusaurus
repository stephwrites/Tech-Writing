#Technical Documentation Using Confluence and Docusaurus

:white_check_mark: **What this guide _is_**
The Documentation Style Guide is a high-level overview of standards for general technical documentation when using either Confluence or Docusaurus. Use this guide as a resource when creating documentation for your projects, products, processes, or anything that requires technical instruction. Feel free to add your expertise or challenge any information presented here.

:x: **What this guide is _not_**
The Documentation Style Guide should not be used in lieu of an official in-house style guide. Any information read here should not override guidance that already exists for your project, within your company, or within your team. This guide is also _not_ a set of rules that must be strictly followed and never modified to suit varying use cases. Use your best judgment to determine what's best for your users!

#Hosting Documentation
Confluence and Docusaurus are highly regarded, industry standard content management systems used for both technical and non-technical documentation. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each, outlined below, when deciding which is the best fit for your use case.

[!TIP] Don't reinvent the wheel!
Make sure sufficient documentation doesn't already exist for your use case, especially if you're using industry standard tools. Vendors may already have teams dedicated to writing robust documentation for their users. Take advantage of existing official documentation to either replace or supplement your available knowledgebase.

##Atlassian Confluence
[Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is an enterprise wiki sollution with a robust set of capabilities. A wiki is a set of web pages that allows collaborative editing of its content and structure by contributors. Wiki pages are contained and stored within a wiki space. Some larger documentation efforts may have their own wiki spaces, but much documentation will live in en existing wiki space for an organization within an enterprise.

Confluence is recommended for **genereal documentation** not associated with any specific project.
