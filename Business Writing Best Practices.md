Follow the tips below to improve your business writing at work or even at home.

## Consider your audience
> [!TIP]
> Who will read your message? What kind of information will your audience take from this communication?

A communication to an executive or management should be written in a professional tone with concise language that exactly conveys the message in a formal, easy-to-scan structure. A proposal should use data and other information to convince the audience that your proposal is worth considering. A report should likewise contain data, plus written overviews and descriptions of findings. In general, when youa re asserting a claim for any professional communication, it's good practice to include data or information that backs up your claim.

## Remember the bottom line up front (BLUF)
> [!TIP]
> Does your message quickly answer the question, "How does this effect me and why should I care?"

Lead your emails and other communications with a [BLUF](https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-to-write-email-with-military-precision): a short, concise statement that declares the purpose of the communication and the action required. The BLUF should quickly answer the five Ws: who, what, where, when, and why.

* **Instead of:**
"It's been a long and fruitful journey, and so many people have volunteered their hard work to help. This effort started in early 2021 and has culminated in a cross-enterprise collaboration of dozens of teams to make sure The Company is on the right track for risk, compliance, and delivery. We are happy to be moving on to the next phase. On February 1st, we will officially be shutting down all OpenShift 3 pipelines and discontinuing service. If your team is on OCP 3 after this date, please migrate to OCP 4 to avoid servie interruptions and make sure you're not introducing risk to the enterprise. We have included migration instructions and more information for teams to make sure they migrate well ahead of the final date."

* **Try:** "Effective February 1st 2023, all OpenShift Container Platform 3 (OCP 3) pipelines will bes hut down and service discontinued. Any teams remaining on OCP 3 **must** migrate to OCP 4 before this date to avoid risk. Further information, including migration instructions, is included below."

The BLUF helps readers quickly scan and digest the important details of your communication. A reader may not necessary want to know all the background information that led to this communication up front; they likely just wants to know how it affects them and what they need to do. **Your BLUF should answer this question every time.**

## Be clear and concise
> [!TIP]
> Is your message easy to understand and scan? Is it free of rambling or unnecessary information? Are all acronyms defined?

Make sure your message won't be misinterpreted, poorly received, or difficult to comprehend. **Do not write stream-of-consciousness or in all bullet points when communicating a professional message.** Include all important information, but aovid obfuscating the message with ambiguous or unnecessary information. Make sure to define all acronyms the first time you use them. If you're unsure of an acronym, ask your peers or do your best to research it.

* **Instead of:** "Although we experienced lower than hoped for engagement, we still hit the mark. Our team also suffered from significant attrition issues this year where we lost some FTEs. But at least production is up from last year."

* **Try:** "Engagement is healthy and production has increased compared to last year, signifying a job well done by our dedicated team members despite attrition of full-time employees."

Ensuring your message contains necessary information worded professionally helps avoid mistakes that can damage your reputation and business relationships.

## Proofread your work
> [!TIP]
> How does your message look? Is it easy to read? Is it structured well? Is it free of spelling and grammar errors?

A communication with simple mistakes can leave a negative impression. Proofreading and running your message through a simple spellcheck, such as the ones built into Microsoft Outlook and Word, can help avoid these mistakes completely. If possible, where the communication's sensitivity allows, ask teammates to review your writing.
